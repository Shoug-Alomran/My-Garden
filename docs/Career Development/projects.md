- Relational schema and data dictionary
- Database implementation using SQL (DDL + constraints)
- Execution of **basic and advanced SQL queries** through application code
- CRUD functionality via a web interface
- Sustainability and maintainability considerations
- Full documentation website built with **MkDocs (Material Theme)**

*Focus:* Relational database design, SQL integration, data integrity, and full-stack application development

## [CS330 — Parallel Performance Evaluation in Linux](https://github.com/Shoug-Alomran/CS330-Parallel-Performance-Evaluation-in-Linux-Project)
**Type:** Operating Systems / Parallel Computing  
**Languages & Tools:** C, Linux (Ubuntu), VirtualBox, GCC, MkDocs  

Conducted an **experimental operating systems project** focused on **process-based parallelism** and performance evaluation in a Linux environment.  
The project analyzes how execution time scales with different input sizes and numbers of processes using instructor-provided C code.

**Highlights:**
- Linux-based execution using a virtual machine  
- Process creation and synchronization using `fork()`  
- Controlled performance experiments with varying parameters  
- Execution time measurement and analysis  
- Clear separation between setup, execution, experiments, and results  
- Documentation website built with MkDocs (Material Theme)

*Focus:* Process management, parallel execution, performance measurement, and reproducible experimentation

Developed a **full software requirements analysis** for the Sillah (صلة) preventive health management system, expanding the original SE201 project using formal SE311 methodologies.  
This project applies the complete Requirements Engineering (RE) process — Inception, Elicitation, Analysis, Specification, Validation, and Requirements Management.

**Highlights:**
- Vision & Scope document (Phase 1)  
- Elicitation notes, stakeholder analysis, and requirement prioritization  
- Functional & non-functional requirements (IEEE 830 structure)  
- UML diagrams (use case, activity, sequence, class)  
- Goal modeling using GRL/URN  
- Traceability matrix and multi‑release planning  
- Full documentation website built with MkDocs (Material Theme)  

*Focus:* Formal requirements engineering, structured documentation, and professional modeling techniques

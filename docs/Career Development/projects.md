## [CS102 — School Course Enrollment System](https://github.com/Shoug-Alomran/CS102-SchoolCourseEnrolmentSystem)
**Type:** Object-Oriented Programming (Java)  
**Languages & Tools:** Java, File I/O, Collections Framework  

A console-based system simulating a **university course registration platform**.  
It features multiple user roles — students, instructors, and administrators — each with specific access and capabilities.  

**Highlights:**
- Role-based authentication system  
- Course creation, enrollment, and grading workflows  
- Persistent data storage using file management  
- Input validation and exception handling  
- Modular class design and reusable helper functions  

 *Focus:* Core Java design, modularity, and robust data handling  

 **Website:** *(Coming soon)*

## [CS285 — Cryptography Project](https://github.com/Shoug-Alomran/CS285-CryptographyProject)
**Type:** Discrete Mathematics / Cryptography  
**Languages & Tools:** Java, Modular Arithmetic  

Implemented a **Secure Key Exchange System** based on the **Diffie-Hellman algorithm**, demonstrating the application of discrete mathematics to secure communications.  

**Highlights:**
- Prime and generator value generation  
- Public/private key pair creation  
- Secure shared key derivation  
- Demonstrated encryption/decryption flow  

 *Focus:* Number theory, modular arithmetic, and applied cryptography

## [SE201 — Sillah Project](https://github.com/Shoug-Alomran/SE201--Sillah-Project)
**Type:** Software Engineering Documentation  
**Languages & Tools:** UML, Requirement Engineering, Visual Paradigm  

Developed a **preventive health management system** that analyzes family medical data to predict hereditary risks and provide early health alerts.  

**Highlights:**
- Software Requirement Specification (SRS)  
- Use case, sequence, and activity diagrams  
- Class and UI design documentation  
- Non-functional requirements analysis  

 *Focus:* Structured system analysis and end-to-end documentation using IEEE standards

## [CS210 — Linked List Implementation & Runtime Analysis](https://github.com/Shoug-Alomran/CS210-Project-Linked-List-Implementation-and-Runtime-Analysis)
**Type:** Data Structures & Algorithms  
**Languages & Tools:** Java  

Implemented a **singly linked list** with performance analysis across different operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.  

**Highlights:**
- Comparative runtime evaluation  
- Algorithm complexity discussion  
- Clean modular code structure  

 *Focus:* Algorithmic efficiency and data structure design

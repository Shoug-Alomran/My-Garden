# 🌸 Me 🌸

I’m **Shoug Fawaz Alomran**, a **Software Engineering & Cybersecurity** student at *Prince Sultan University*.  
My work sits at the intersection of **ethical penetration testing**, **personal app development**, and **practical user protection** — I look for ways systems can be improved and build tools that make those improvements real.

---

## 🎯 What I do

- **Ethical Penetration Testing** — I explore systems for weaknesses so they can be fixed before attackers find them. I follow responsible disclosure practices and always work within legal and organizational boundaries.
- **Application Development** — I build small apps and automation tools (often for personal use or to solve a specific workflow problem), focusing on secure coding practices.
- **Protecting People** — My primary goal is to help teams and users stay safer online by turning findings into concrete fixes and better-aware designs.

## 💼 Current roles & experience

- **Cybersecurity Trainee** at *MDD* — hands-on experience with penetration testing tasks, network analysis, and security hardening.
- **Course Instructor** at *Qimah* — developing learning resources and teaching methods that help students understand complex topics.
- **Peer Tutor** at *Prince Sultan University WTC* — mentoring students in technical subjects and academic communication.

## 🛡️ Ethics & approach

I follow a strict ethics-first approach:
- I operate only with **permission** (engagements, bug bounties, or lab environments).  
- I practice **responsible disclosure** — privately reporting vulnerabilities and helping coordinate safe remediation.  
- I emphasize **secure development**: fixes, mitigations, and user-centred protections over exploitation.

---

## 🧠 Technical focus areas

- Penetration testing (web, network, basic exploitation techniques)  
- Secure app development (secure APIs, input validation, authentication)  
- Tools & automation for security testing  
- Research-driven learning (HackerOne writeups, academic papers, hands-on labs)

---

## 🏅 Notable training & certifications

- **AI in Robotics Bootcamp 2025** — Prince Sultan University  
- **First Aid Provider** — Saudi Red Crescent Authority  
- Ongoing: practical labs (tryhackme, hackthebox), recommended certification path (e.g., OSCP when ready)

## 🌿 Why this matters

Security that protects people comes from finding the problems early and fixing them fast. I enjoy both sides of that work: the investigative, creative side of penetration testing, and the constructive side of building apps and protections that make systems safer for everyone.

> **Note:** I only practice security testing in legal contexts — on my own infrastructure, authorized engagements, or controlled labs. If you’d like to collaborate on a security assessment for your project, I can help set up an authorized testing plan and responsible disclosure process.

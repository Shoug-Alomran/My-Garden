# 🧩 Software Engineering

Software Engineering is the discipline of designing, building, testing, and maintaining reliable and scalable software systems.  
It blends **computer science principles** with **engineering practices** to ensure that software is not only functional but also efficient, maintainable, and user-centric.

In this section, you’ll find:
- Notes and insights from my university coursework and personal learning.
- Documentation of team and individual projects.
- Reflections on design patterns, agile methods, and software architecture.

🧠 *Goal:* To continuously refine my understanding of how software is planned, structured, and evolved — from early requirements to real-world deployment.

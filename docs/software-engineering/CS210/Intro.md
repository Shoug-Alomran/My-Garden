# CS210 — Data Structures and Algorithms
## Course Chapters & Lesson Overview
This course teaches how data is organized, stored, and processed. Students learn essential data structures, algorithm analysis, and practical implementation techniques.

### Linked Objects and Data Structures
- How data is represented in memory
- Object references and dynamic structures

### Linked Lists (Single, Double, Circular)
- Implementing and manipulating linked lists
- Traversal, insertion, deletion

### Analysis of Algorithms
- Big-O notation
- Time and space complexity
- Iterative vs recursive analysis

### Sorting Algorithms
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort

### Stacks and Queues
- LIFO and FIFO structures
- Applications in compilers and operating systems

### Binary Trees & Binary Search Trees
- Tree traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)
- Searching, insertion, deletion

### AVL Trees
- Self-balancing trees
- Rotations and height maintenance

### Heaps & Priority Queues
- Binary heaps
- Heap operations and applications

### Hashing (Chaining, Probing)
- Hash functions
- Collision resolution techniques

### Graphs (Directed & Undirected)
- Graph representations
- DFS and BFS
- Real-world applications

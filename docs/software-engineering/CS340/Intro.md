# CS340 — Introduction to Database Systems
## Course Chapters & Lesson Overview
This course introduces the foundations of database systems, data modeling, relational theory, SQL, normalization, and emerging database technologies. Students learn how to design, build, query, and optimize databases using conceptual, logical, and physical modeling techniques.

- Enhanced ER modeling (specialization, generalization)
- UML-based conceptual modeling
- Designing complex database applications

### Chapter 5: Relational Data Model & Constraints
- Relations, tuples, attributes
- Keys and integrity constraints
- Entity integrity and referential integrity

### Chapter 9: ER-to-Relational Mapping
- Converting ER/EER diagrams into relational schemas
- Mapping entities, relationships, and constraints
- Preparing for implementation

### Chapter 8: Relational Algebra
- Selection, projection, joins, division
- Query formulation using algebraic operators

### Chapter 6: Basic SQL
- SQL data definition (DDL)
- Constraints and table creation
- Basic SELECT queries and filtering

### Chapter 7: Advanced SQL
- Nested queries
- Aggregation and grouping
- Views and virtual tables
- Complex SQL operations

### Chapters 14 & 15: Functional Dependencies & Normalization

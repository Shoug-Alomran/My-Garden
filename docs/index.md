# Hi, I’m Shoug Fawaz Alomran

Software Engineering & Cybersecurity student at Prince Sultan University, with hands-on work in penetration testing, structured technical documentation, and course support (instruction and peer tutoring).

This digital garden is where I publish clear, organized notes, practical projects, and curated learning resources built for students, instructors, and employers.

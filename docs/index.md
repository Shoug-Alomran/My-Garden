# Welcome

Hi, I’m **Shoug Fawaz Alomran**, a **software engineering and cybersecurity student** with a strong focus on **penetration testing, system design, and structured technical work**.

This site is my Digital Garden. It is a living, growing space where I document what I learn, build, and teach, across software engineering, computer science, and cybersecurity.

It serves four main purposes:

* Support students with structured learning material
* Demonstrate clarity and documentation quality to instructors
* Showcase real technical work and growth to employers
* Share knowledge publicly in a clear and evolving way

---

## What You’ll Find Here

### Learn

Structured notes, summaries, quizzes, and study material from my university courses:

* **Software Engineering (SE)**: SE201, SE311
* **Computer Science (CS)**: CS285, CS210, CS330, CS340
* **Cyber Security (CYS)**: CYS401

This section is designed for revision, understanding, and practical learning, not just storing notes.

Start here if you are a student or exploring a technical topic.

### Career

A professional overview of my work and development, including:

* My profile and technical focus
* Academic and practical projects
* My resume (CV)
* Workshops, teaching, and documentation work

This section shows how I work, not just what I claim to know.

Start here if you are an employer or an instructor.

---

### Resources

A curated collection of tools, references, and links I rely on in my studies and technical work.

## How to Explore

* Use the navigation on the left to browse by topic or section
* Use the search bar to jump directly to specific concepts
* Think of each page as a small, focused piece of a larger system of knowledge

This garden grows over time, one project, one concept, and one insight at a time.

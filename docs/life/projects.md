## 🔐 [CS285 — Cryptography Project](https://github.com/Shoug-Alomran/CS285-CryptographyProject)
**Type:** Discrete Mathematics / Cryptography  
**Languages & Tools:** Java, Modular Arithmetic  

Implemented a **Secure Key Exchange System** based on the **Diffie-Hellman algorithm**, demonstrating the application of discrete mathematics to secure communications.  

**Highlights:**
- Prime and generator value generation  
- Public/private key pair creation  
- Secure shared key derivation  
- Demonstrated encryption/decryption flow  

🧠 *Focus:* Number theory, modular arithmetic, and applied cryptography

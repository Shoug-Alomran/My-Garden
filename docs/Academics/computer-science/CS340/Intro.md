# CS340 Introduction to Database Systems

This course introduces the foundations of database systems, including data modeling, the relational model, SQL, normalization, and emerging database technologies. It focuses on how databases are designed, implemented, queried, and optimized using conceptual, logical, and physical modeling techniques.

This section contains my structured study material for CS340, including:

* Chapter notes
* Quizzes and practice questions
* Mind maps for selected chapters
* A cheat sheet and symbols reference
* A full course summary in PDF format

The goal of this section is to provide a clear and practical resource for understanding database systems and for preparing for exams and projects.

## How to Use This Section

* If you are following the course, start with the introduction and data modeling chapters, then continue in order.
* If you are revising, use the cheat sheet, symbols page, summaries, and quizzes.
* If you are working on the project, focus on the modeling, mapping, and SQL chapters.

This page is the main entry point to all CS340 material.

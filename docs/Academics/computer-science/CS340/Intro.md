# :floppy_disk: CS340 — Introduction to Database Systems

This course introduces the foundations of database systems, including data
modeling, the relational model, SQL, normalization, and emerging database
technologies. It focuses on how databases are designed, implemented, queried,
and optimized using conceptual, logical, and physical modeling techniques.

This section contains structured study material including chapter notes,
quizzes and practice questions, mind maps for selected chapters, a cheat sheet
and symbols reference, and a full course summary in PDF format. The goal is a
clear, practical resource for understanding database systems and preparing for
exams and projects.

## :compass: How to Use This Section

Depending on where you are in the course, use this section differently.

If you are **following the course**, start with the introduction and data
modeling chapters, then continue in order. If you are **revising**, use the
cheat sheet, symbols page, summaries, and quizzes. If you are **working on the
project**, focus on the modeling, mapping, and SQL chapters.

## :globe_with_meridians: Emerging Database Topics

This section also covers topics beyond the traditional relational model —
including an introduction to object-oriented databases, NoSQL concepts, and
hands-on MongoDB CRUD operations through lab work.

---

## :hammer_and_wrench: Project & Applied Work

The final project brings the course together through database design and
modeling, SQL implementation, team-based collaboration, and full demonstration
and documentation. The modeling, mapping, and SQL chapters are the most
directly relevant references for project work.

## :notepad_spiral: Study & Revision Material

In addition to the chapter notes, this section includes quizzes for multiple
chapters, mind maps for selected topics, a cheat sheet and symbols reference,
and a full course summary in PDF format. These are designed to support both
deep understanding and efficient exam preparation.

# Computer Science

This section focuses on the core computer science foundations that support software engineering and cybersecurity work. It documents my learning in data structures, algorithms, operating systems, databases, and discrete mathematics, with an emphasis on understanding how systems work internally and how they can be designed efficiently and correctly.

The material here combines theoretical concepts with practical system level thinking. A large part of this section is about learning how to reason about performance, structure, and correctness, not just how to write code.

In this section, you will find:

- Structured course material from computer science subjects such as CS210, CS285, CS330, and CS340  
- Notes on data structures, algorithms, operating systems, databases, and discrete mathematics  
- Supporting material such as summaries, cheat sheets, quizzes, and mind maps  
- Content focused on both conceptual understanding and practical application  

The goal of this section is to build a strong foundation in computer science that supports my work in software engineering and cybersecurity, especially in areas where system design, performance, and reliability matter.

This section serves as the entry point to my computer science coursework and study material.

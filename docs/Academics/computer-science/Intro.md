# Computer Science Courses

Computer Science is the study of how systems are designed, built, and optimized to solve real-world problems through computation. These courses develop both **theoretical foundations** and **practical engineering skills**, covering areas such as algorithms, software development, systems architecture, data management, and security.

Each subject builds progressively on core principles — computational thinking, abstraction, problem decomposition, and efficient implementation — while emphasizing structured design, correctness, and performance.

Through these courses, students gain:

* Strong programming and problem-solving skills
* Understanding of data structures and algorithmic efficiency
* Knowledge of system-level concepts and architecture
* Experience with software engineering practices
* Exposure to emerging technologies and applied computing domains

Together, these subjects form a structured pathway toward becoming a disciplined and capable computing professional.

# :desktop_computer: Computer Science

This section focuses on the core computer science foundations that support
software engineering and cybersecurity work. It documents my learning in data
structures, algorithms, operating systems, databases, and discrete mathematics
— with an emphasis on understanding how systems work internally and how they
can be designed efficiently and correctly.

The material here combines theoretical concepts with practical system-level
thinking. A large part of this section is about learning how to reason about
performance, structure, and correctness — not just how to write code.

## :brain: What This Section Is About

These courses form the theoretical and systems-level backbone of my degree.
Understanding data structures makes me a better algorithm designer.
Understanding operating systems makes me a better systems thinker.
Understanding databases makes me a better application architect. And
understanding discrete mathematics gives me the formal reasoning tools that
underpin all of it.

This is not just coursework documentation — it is the foundation that
connects directly to my work in software engineering and cybersecurity.

!!! note "About This Section"
    All material is based on my own coursework and personal study at Prince
    Sultan University. The focus is on clarity, depth, and practical
    understanding. Content will continue to be refined and expanded over time.

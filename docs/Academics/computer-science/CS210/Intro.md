# :books: CS210 — Data Structures and Algorithms

This course focuses on how data is organized, stored, and processed efficiently.
It covers fundamental data structures, algorithm analysis, and practical
implementation techniques essential for software development and system design.

This section contains structured study material including topic-based notes,
algorithm analysis explanations, and cheat sheets for revision and quick
reference. The goal is a clear, practical resource for understanding the
material and preparing for exams and programming tasks.

## :compass: How to Use This Section

Depending on where you are in the course, use this section differently.

If you are **following the course**, start with the basic data representation
topics and progress toward more advanced structures in order. If you are
**revising**, go directly to the cheat sheets and the topics you find most
difficult. If you are **practicing implementation**, use the topic pages as
references for behavior, operations, and complexity.

## :notepad_spiral: Study & Revision Material

In addition to the topic notes, this section includes cheat sheets for quick
revision and condensed references for common operations and complexities.
These are designed to support both deep understanding and efficient exam
preparation.

!!! note "About This Material"
    These notes are based on my own coursework and personal study. The focus
    is on clarity, structure, and practical understanding. Content will
    continue to be refined and expanded over time.

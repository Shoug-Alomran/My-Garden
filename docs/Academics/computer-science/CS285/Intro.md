# CS285 Discrete Math for Computing

This course builds the mathematical foundation required for computing. It covers logic, sets, functions, number theory, counting, relations, and proof techniques that are used throughout computer science.

This section contains my structured study material for CS285, including:

* Chapter based notes
* Explanations of core concepts and proof techniques
* A cheat sheet for revision and quick reference

The goal of this section is to provide a clear and practical resource for understanding discrete mathematics and for preparing for exams and problem solving tasks.

## How to Use This Section

* If you are following the course, start from Chapter 1 and continue in order.
* If you are revising, focus on the cheat sheet and the chapters you find most challenging.
* If you are practicing problem solving, use the chapter notes as references for definitions, theorems, and methods.

This page is the main entry point to all CS285 material.

## Why this is better than the current version

* It turns the page into a real course entry point instead of just a list of topics
* It explains how to study and use the material
* It matches the structure and quality of your other course overview pages
* It makes the section feel intentional, organized, and professional
* It is more useful for both students and instructors

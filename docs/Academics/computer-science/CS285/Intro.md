# :abacus: CS285 — Discrete Math for Computing

This course builds the mathematical foundation required for computing. It covers
logic, sets, functions, number theory, counting, relations, and proof techniques
that are used throughout computer science.

This section contains structured study material including chapter-based notes,
explanations of core concepts and proof techniques, and a cheat sheet for
revision and quick reference. The goal is a clear, practical resource for
understanding discrete mathematics and preparing for exams and problem-solving
tasks.

## :compass: How to Use This Section

Depending on where you are in the course, use this section differently.

If you are **following the course**, start from Chapter 1 and continue in
order — the chapters build on each other deliberately. If you are **revising**,
go directly to the cheat sheet and the chapters you find most challenging. If
you are **practicing problem solving**, use the chapter notes as references for
definitions, theorems, and methods.

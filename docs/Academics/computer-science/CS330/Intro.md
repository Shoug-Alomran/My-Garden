# CS330 Introduction to Operating Systems

This course introduces the core concepts behind modern operating systems. It focuses on how operating systems manage hardware, processes, memory, storage, synchronization, and file systems, using real world examples from Unix and Windows to connect theory to practice.

This section contains my structured study material for CS330, including:

* Chapter notes
* Quizzes and practice questions
* A course summary
* A cheat sheet for revision

The goal of this section is to provide a clear and practical resource for understanding operating systems concepts and for preparing for exams and assessments.

## How to Use This Section

* If you are following the course, start from Chapter 1 and continue in order.
* If you are revising, focus on the cheat sheet, summary, and quizzes.
* If you are working on the practical Unix Linux project, use the relevant chapters as references for commands and concepts.

This page is the main entry point to all CS330 material.

## Recommended Study Path

1. Start with the basic OS concepts in Chapters 1 and 2
2. Study processes and threads before moving to scheduling
3. Focus on synchronization carefully, as it is conceptually important
4. Continue with memory management and virtual memory
5. Study storage and file systems
6. Use the cheat sheet, summary, and quizzes for revision

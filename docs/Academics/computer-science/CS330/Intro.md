# CS330 — Introduction to Operating Systems
## Course Chapters & Lesson Overview
This course introduces the core concepts behind modern operating systems. Students learn how OSes manage hardware, processes, memory, storage, synchronization, and file systems. Real-world examples from Unix and Windows help connect theory to practice.

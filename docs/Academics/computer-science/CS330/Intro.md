# :computer: CS330 — Introduction to Operating Systems

This course introduces the core concepts behind modern operating systems. It
focuses on how operating systems manage hardware, processes, memory, storage,
synchronization, and file systems — using real-world examples from Unix and
Windows to connect theory to practice.

This section contains structured study material including chapter notes,
quizzes and practice questions, a course summary, and a cheat sheet for
revision. The goal is a clear, practical resource for understanding operating
systems concepts and preparing for exams and assessments.

## :compass: How to Use This Section

Depending on where you are in the course, use this section differently.

If you are **following the course**, start from Chapter 1 and continue in
order. If you are **revising**, focus on the cheat sheet, summary, and quizzes.
If you are **working on the Unix/Linux project**, use the relevant chapters as
references for commands and concepts.

# :wrench: Software Engineering

This section focuses on software engineering as a structured discipline — from
requirements and planning to design, implementation, testing, and project
management. It documents my learning and applied work in building software
systems in a deliberate, organized, and requirements-driven way.

A large part of my work in software engineering emphasizes structure,
documentation, and process. I am particularly interested in how systems are
specified, designed, and communicated before they are built, and how good
engineering practices improve reliability, maintainability, and long-term
quality.

## :brain: What This Section Is About

There is a meaningful difference between writing code and engineering software.
Engineering means thinking carefully about what a system needs to do before
building it, modeling its structure clearly enough that others can understand
and maintain it, and following practices that make the final product reliable
and predictable.

That distinction is what this section is built around. The courses here pushed
me to think about software not just as something that runs, but as something
that has to be planned, communicated, tested, and sustained over time. Those
habits of thinking carry directly into my work in cybersecurity and systems
design — where structure and precision matter just as much.

## :notepad_spiral: Supporting Material

Across these courses, this section includes summaries, cheat sheets, quizzes,
and documentation related to diagrams, modeling, and system structure — all
designed to support both conceptual understanding and practical application.

!!! note "About This Section"
    All material is based on my own coursework and personal study at Prince
    Sultan University. The focus is on clarity, depth, and practical
    understanding. Content will continue to be refined and expanded over time.

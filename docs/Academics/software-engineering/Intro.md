# Software Engineering

This section focuses on software engineering as a structured discipline, from requirements and planning to design, implementation, testing, and project management. It documents my learning and applied work in building software systems in a deliberate, organized, and requirements driven way.

A large part of my work in software engineering emphasizes structure, documentation, and process. I am particularly interested in how systems are specified, designed, and communicated before they are built, and how good engineering practices improve reliability, maintainability, and long term quality.

In this section, you will find:

- Structured course material from software engineering subjects such as SE201 and SE311  
- Notes on software processes, requirements engineering, design, testing, and project management  
- Documentation related to diagrams, modeling, and system structure  
- Supporting material such as summaries, cheat sheets, and quizzes  

The goal of this section is to strengthen my ability to think and work like an engineer, not just a programmer, by focusing on planning, structure, documentation, and disciplined development practices.

This section serves as the entry point to my software engineering coursework and study material.

# :pencil: SE201 — Introduction to Software Engineering

This course covers the fundamental principles, processes, and ethics of
software engineering. It focuses on how software is planned, designed,
implemented, tested, and maintained in real-world environments.

This section contains structured study material including chapter notes,
quizzes and practice questions, cheat sheets and summaries, a UML and
diagrams guide, and additional reference material. The goal is a clear,
practical study resource — not just a list of notes.

## :compass: How to Use This Section

Depending on where you are in the course, use this section differently.

If you are **following the course week by week**, start with Chapter 1 and
continue in order. If you are **revising for quizzes or exams**, use the
cheat sheet, summaries, and quizzes. If you are **working on diagrams or
design tasks**, go directly to the UML and diagrams guide.

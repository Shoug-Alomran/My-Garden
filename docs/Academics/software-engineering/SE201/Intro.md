# SE201 Introduction to Software Engineering

This course covers the fundamental principles, processes, and ethics of software engineering. It focuses on how software is planned, designed, implemented, tested, and maintained in real-world environments.

This section contains my structured study material for SE201, including:
- Chapter notes
- Quizzes and practice questions
- Cheat sheets and summaries
- UML and software engineering diagrams guide
- Additional reference material

The goal of this section is to provide a clear and practical study resource, not just a list of notes.

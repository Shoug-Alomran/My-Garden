# :pencil2: SE311 — Software Requirements Engineering

This course focuses on how software requirements are discovered, analyzed,
documented, validated, and managed. It covers elicitation techniques, modeling
methods, documentation standards, and how to handle evolving requirements in
real projects.

This section contains structured study material including chapter notes,
quizzes and practice questions, a midterm cheat sheet, and supporting diagrams
and examples. The goal is a clear, practical study resource for understanding
requirements engineering and preparing for assessments.

## :compass: How to Use This Section

Depending on where you are in the course, use this section differently.

If you are **following the course**, start from Chapter 1 and continue in
order. If you are **revising**, use the midterm cheat sheet and quizzes to
test your understanding. If you are **working on modeling or analysis tasks**,
focus on the modeling chapters and their examples.

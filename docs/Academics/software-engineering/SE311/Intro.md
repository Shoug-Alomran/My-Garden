# SE311 Software Requirements Engineering

This course focuses on how software requirements are discovered, analyzed, documented, validated, and managed. It covers elicitation techniques, modeling methods, documentation standards, and how to handle evolving requirements in real projects.

This section contains my structured study material for SE311, including:

* Chapter notes
* Quizzes and practice questions
* A midterm cheat sheet
* Supporting diagrams and examples

The goal of this section is to provide a clear, practical study resource for understanding requirements engineering and preparing for assessments.

## How to Use This Section

* If you are following the course, start from Chapter 1 and continue in order.
* If you are revising, use the midterm cheat sheet and the quizzes to test your understanding.
* If you are working on modeling or analysis tasks, focus on the modeling chapters and their examples.

This page is the main entry point to all SE311 material.

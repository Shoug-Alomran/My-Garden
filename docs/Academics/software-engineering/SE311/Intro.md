# SE311 — Software Requirements Engineering
## Course Chapters & Lesson Overview
This course explores how software requirements are discovered, analyzed, documented, validated, and managed. Students learn elicitation techniques, modeling methods, documentation standards, and how to manage evolving requirements in real projects.

### Chapter 1: Basics of Requirements Engineering

- Relationship to ISO/IEC 12207
- Writing high-quality requirement documents

### Chapter 3: Requirements Inception & Problem Analysis
- Understanding the problem domain
- Business requirements
- Vision and scope documents
- Project viability analysis

### Chapter 4: Requirements Elicitation
- Goals, risks, and challenges
- Sources of requirements
- Elicitation tasks and techniques
- Interviews, workshops, observation, prototyping

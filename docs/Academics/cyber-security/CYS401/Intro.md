# CYS401 Fundamentals of Cybersecurity

This course introduces the core concepts, technologies, and practices of cybersecurity in organizational and real world contexts. It focuses on understanding threats and attacks, applying security principles, and designing countermeasures to protect modern systems and information assets.

This section contains my structured study material for CYS401, including:

* Topic based notes covering core cybersecurity domains
* Quizzes and practice questions
* Supporting examples and explanations

The goal of this section is to provide a clear and practical resource for understanding cybersecurity fundamentals and for preparing for exams and applied discussions.

## How to Use This Section

* If you are following the course, start with the introduction and security foundations topics and continue in order.
* If you are revising, focus on the quizzes and the sections you find most conceptually dense.
* If you are interested in specific domains such as cryptography, cloud security, or web security, you can jump directly to those topics.

This page is the main entry point to all CYS401 material.

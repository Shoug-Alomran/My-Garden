# :lock: CYS401 — Fundamentals of Cybersecurity

This course introduces the core concepts, technologies, and practices of
cybersecurity in organizational and real-world contexts. It focuses on
understanding threats and attacks, applying security principles, and designing
countermeasures to protect modern systems and information assets.

This section contains structured study material including topic-based notes
covering core cybersecurity domains, quizzes and practice questions, and
supporting examples and explanations. The goal is a clear, practical resource
for understanding cybersecurity fundamentals and preparing for exams and
applied discussions.

## :compass: How to Use This Section

Depending on where you are in the course, use this section differently.

If you are **following the course**, start with the introduction and security
foundations topics and continue in order. If you are **revising**, focus on
the quizzes and the sections you find most conceptually dense. If you are
**interested in a specific domain** such as cryptography, cloud security, or
web security, you can jump directly to that topic.

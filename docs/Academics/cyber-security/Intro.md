# Cyber Security

This section focuses on cybersecurity from both a defensive and an attacker minded perspective. It documents my learning in protecting systems, networks, and data, while also understanding how those systems can be analyzed, tested, and broken in a controlled and ethical way.

My primary interest in this area is penetration testing and security analysis. I approach security by studying how systems are designed, where they fail, and how weaknesses can be identified and mitigated.

In this section, you will find:

- Structured course material from cybersecurity related subjects such as CYS401  
- Notes on security principles, threats, attacks, and protection mechanisms  
- Topics covering cryptography, system security, web security, and architecture level security  
- Quizzes and study material for revision and concept reinforcement  

The goal of this section is to build a strong foundation in cybersecurity fundamentals while developing the mindset needed to analyze systems critically, identify weaknesses, and think like both a defender and an attacker.

This section serves as the entry point to my cybersecurity related coursework and study material.

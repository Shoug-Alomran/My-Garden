# :shield: Cyber Security

This section focuses on cybersecurity from both a defensive and an
attacker-minded perspective. It documents my learning in protecting systems,
networks, and data — while also understanding how those systems can be
analyzed, tested, and broken in a controlled and ethical way.

My primary interest in this area is penetration testing and security analysis.
I approach security by studying how systems are designed, where they fail, and
how weaknesses can be identified and mitigated.

## :brain: What This Section Is About

Cybersecurity is not just about defense — it is about understanding systems
deeply enough to know where they break. That mindset shapes how I approach
everything in this section.

Studying cryptography teaches me how trust is built into systems. Studying
attack techniques teaches me where assumptions fail. Studying architecture-level
security teaches me how to design systems that are harder to compromise from
the start. Together, these build the kind of critical, analytical thinking that
penetration testing and security work demand.

This is the foundation I am building toward a career in offensive security and
security analysis.

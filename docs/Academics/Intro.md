# Learn

Welcome to the learning hub of **Shoug’s Digital Garden**.

This section contains **structured course notes, summaries, cheat sheets, quizzes, and study guides** from my studies in:

* Software Engineering
* Computer Science
* Cyber Security

The goal is simple:

> Make complex topics clearer, more structured, and easier to revise — for myself and for other students.

Everything here is organized **by course** and **by topic/chapter**, so you can either:

* Follow a course from start to finish, or
* Jump directly to a specific topic you need.

# Academics

This section documents my academic journey — not just the courses I completed, but how my understanding evolved through them.

Each subject represents a stage of growth. Some strengthened my logical reasoning. Others trained me to think in systems, design with structure, or approach problems methodically. Over time, these courses reshaped the way I analyze complexity, break down ambiguity, and build solutions with intention.

Inside each course, you will find:

* Structured chapter notes
* Concept explanations and summaries
* Diagrams and modeling references
* Cheat sheets and revision material
* Quizzes and practice collections
* Reflections tied to key learning moments

What began as class notes gradually became something more deliberate — a curated knowledge base. Writing and organizing these materials helped me move from simply *studying* concepts to truly *owning* them.

This section reflects that transition:
from coursework → to understanding → to disciplined documentation.

It is both a record of what I learned and a representation of how I think.

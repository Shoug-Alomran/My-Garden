# Topics & Learning Outcomes

## Main Themes

- **Fundamental cyber-attack methodologies**  
  Basic phases of an attack (reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, post-exploitation).

- **Adopting an attacker’s perspective**  
  How thinking like an attacker helps you design better defenses.

- **Exploiting vulnerabilities in systems and networks**  
  High-level look at common classes of vulnerabilities and how they’re abused.

- **Detecting security vulnerabilities**  
  Using tools, checklists, and structured processes to identify weaknesses.

- **Assessing vulnerabilities and weaknesses**  
  Prioritizing issues based on risk, impact, and ease of exploitation.

- **Overview of ethical hacking**  
  Legal and ethical boundaries, responsible disclosure, and professional conduct.

## What I Should Be Able to Do After This Workshop

- Describe the basic steps an attacker takes during a typical compromise.
- Explain the difference between offensive testing and malicious hacking.
- Read high-level vulnerability descriptions and understand why they matter.
- Connect offensive techniques with defensive controls (e.g., hardening, monitoring).

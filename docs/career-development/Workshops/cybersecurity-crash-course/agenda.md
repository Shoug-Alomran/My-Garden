## High-Level Flow

!!! info "How the workshop was structured"
    Each session built on the previous one — moving from mindset and theory 
    on Day 1, through hands-on exploitation on Day 2, to detection, defense, 
    and ethics on Day 3.

1. **Setting goals** — defining the workshop scope and what "offensive security" means
2. **Exploring attack methodologies** — how real attackers approach and plan against targets
3. **Hands-on demonstrations and labs** — finding and exploiting weaknesses in practice
4. **Detection and assessment** — linking offensive techniques to practical defensive controls
5. **Ethical considerations** — responsible use of offensive techniques and legal boundaries

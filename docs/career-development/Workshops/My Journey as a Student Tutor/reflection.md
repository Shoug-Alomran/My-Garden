This journey as a student tutor has been one of the most meaningful parts of
my time at university — and one I didn't fully anticipate when I started.

When I joined the Writing & Tutoring Center, my goal was straightforward: help
other students understand the material. What I didn't expect was how much the
experience would shape me in return.

Session by session, I grew more confident in breaking down complex ideas, more
patient with different learning styles, and more intentional about how I
prepared and communicated. Tutoring has a way of holding you accountable.

Balancing tutoring alongside my studies, cybersecurity training, and leadership
responsibilities wasn't easy. But that balance is where the real growth
happened. It pushed me to develop discipline I wouldn't have found otherwise —
to prioritize without losing quality, to show up consistently, and to support
others not just academically but as a person.

The most rewarding moments were never about the content. They were the moments
when a student who had been struggling finally got it — when their confidence
visibly shifted. That's what made every session worth it.

    Teaching forced deeper understanding — not just enough to pass, but enough
    to explain clearly to someone else.

-   :handshake: **Stronger Relationships**

    ---

    I learned to meet students where they were — academically and emotionally.

    ---

    The discipline, communication, and reliability I built here carry directly
    into my professional work.

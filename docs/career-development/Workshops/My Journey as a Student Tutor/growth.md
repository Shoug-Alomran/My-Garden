# :seedling: Academic & Personal Growth
← [Back to Workshops](../index.md)

Tutoring pushed me to grow in ways I didn't expect. Beyond helping others
understand the material, it challenged me to deepen my own knowledge, sharpen
how I communicate, and manage competing responsibilities — all at once.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: How I Grew

Taking on a teaching role while navigating my own coursework and professional
commitments shaped me in several meaningful ways.

Explaining complex topics to others forced me to truly understand them myself
— not just well enough to pass, but well enough to teach. That process made me
a sharper thinker and a more confident communicator. Working with students who
had different learning styles taught me to read a room, adjust my approach on
the fly, and stay patient when something wasn't clicking.

Managing tutoring sessions alongside an internship and leadership
responsibilities also pushed me to develop stronger time management habits.
I learned to prioritize effectively and show up fully prepared regardless of
what else was on my plate.

*These experiences have shaped not just how I teach, but how I work, think,
and lead.*

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: How Tutoring Shaped My Journey

Stepping into a teaching role while managing my own studies pushed me to grow
in ways I didn't anticipate. I became sharper at explaining complex ideas,
more patient with different learning styles, and more deliberate about how I
prepared and communicated. Tutoring didn't just help others — it made me
better at everything else I was doing at the same time.

A curated index of my academic and applied projects in software engineering, 
cybersecurity, and computer science — listed from most recent to oldest to 
reflect my technical growth over time.

Most projects were developed in university team contexts. My contributions 
consistently focus on **system structure, documentation, integration, and 
deployment** — taking projects beyond minimum requirements to produce complete, 
usable systems.

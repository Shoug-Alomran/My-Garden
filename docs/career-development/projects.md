# Academic Projects

This page is a curated index of my academic and applied projects in software engineering, cybersecurity, and computer science.
Projects are listed **from most recent to oldest** to reflect my technical growth over time.

Most of these projects were developed as part of university courses and team work. My contributions typically focus on **system structure, documentation, integration, and deployment**, and on taking projects beyond minimum requirements to produce complete, usable systems. Each entry links to a dedicated project site or repository with full technical details.

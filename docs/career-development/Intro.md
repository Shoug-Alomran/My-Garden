I am a **software engineering and cybersecurity student** with a strong focus on 
**penetration testing, system analysis, and structured technical work**. My academic 
path leads to a degree titled **Software Engineer / Cyber Security**, and my practical 
work already reflects that direction.

Alongside my studies, I:

* Work as a **part-time cybersecurity intern**
* Serve as a **university tutor**
* Teach a **private psychology course** on an educational platform
* Build and maintain technical systems, documentation, and learning resources

My long-term goal is to work in **cybersecurity with a red team mindset** — thinking 
like an attacker to identify weaknesses, break systems safely, and help build stronger 
defenses. At the same time, I deliberately develop **software engineering skills** 
(web, systems, and backend concepts) to become a well-rounded engineer who understands 
both **how systems are built** and **how they are broken**.

## How to Use This Section

* **If you are an employer** → Start with **Projects** and **Resume**
* **If you are an instructor** → Explore **Workshops** and how I document and structure technical work
* **If you are a student** → You can see how I approach learning, projects, and technical documentation

This section is meant to show **how I work**, not just what I claim to know.

## What I Focus On

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :shield: **Cybersecurity**

    Penetration testing mindset and attacker methodology. Vulnerability analysis 
    and system weakness identification. Ethical and structured security testing.
    
    Long-term goal: red team, then broader blue/purple team exposure.

-   :computer: **Software Engineering**

    System design and documentation. Databases and backend concepts. Structured 
    development and requirements-driven work.
    
    Web systems, deployment, and hosting — including building and maintaining 
    this site.

-   :books: **Learning & Teaching**

    University tutoring and workshop participation. Clear, structured technical 
    documentation. Explaining complex topics in a practical, usable way.
    
    Strong preference for hands-on, applied learning over purely theoretical study.

</div>

## Projects

Most of my projects are **university-based and team-oriented**, but my role 
consistently goes beyond minimum requirements — especially in:

* Building and deploying project websites
* Structuring documentation and deliverables
* Turning prototypes into working, hosted systems
* Taking responsibility for technical integration and presentation

I am especially proud of:

* A **CS102 project** that I built almost entirely from scratch under difficult 
  team conditions
* An **SE201 project** where I took the prototype further than required, converting 
  it into a deployed system using modern tooling

Each project is documented with:

* The problem it addresses
* The system design and implementation approach
* My personal contribution
* What I learned from building it

## Workshops & Teaching

I was invited to speak about my **experience as a student tutor**, focusing on 
mentorship, instructional structure, and professional growth. In addition, I 
participated in technical workshops including a **Cybersecurity Crash Course** 
and documented the work in detail. My instructors specifically noted the 
**quality and depth of my documentation** compared to peers.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :microphone: **My Journey as a Student Tutor**

    Invited speaker workshop. Covers mentorship, communication, instructional 
    structure, and professional growth. Documented with full timeline, skills 
    breakdown, feedback, and reflection.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: View Workshop](./Workshops/My%20Journey%20as%20a%20Student%20Tutor/overview.md)

-   :lock: **Cybersecurity Crash Course**

    Technical workshop with full documentation — session handouts, Bandit notes, 
    agenda, topics covered, and personal reflection.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: View Workshop](./Workshops/cybersecurity-crash-course/overview.md)

</div>

These workshops demonstrate my ability to **communicate technical material clearly**, 
my commitment to **structured, high-quality documentation**, and my interest in 
**teaching, mentoring, and knowledge sharing**.

## How I Work

I am:

* Detail-oriented and systems-focused
* Strong in documentation, structure, and organization
* Practical and hands-on in how I learn
* More effective in **building and testing** than in purely theoretical or 
  exam-based environments

I care deeply about:

* Doing work properly, not just "good enough"
* Taking projects beyond minimum requirements
* Making technical work **clear, usable, and well-presented**
* Continuously improving both my **engineering** and **security** skill sets

---

## Why This Exists

This website is:

* A **living record** of my technical growth
* A **portfolio of real work**, not just claims
* A demonstration of how I **design, document, and explain systems**
* A place where **software engineering, cybersecurity, and teaching** meet

It reflects not only what I know, but **how I apply, structure, and communicate 
that knowledge**.

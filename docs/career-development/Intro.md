# Career Development

I am a **software engineering and cybersecurity student** with a strong focus on **penetration testing, system analysis, and structured technical work**. My academic path leads to a degree titled **Software Engineer / Cyber Security**, and my practical work already reflects that direction.

Alongside my studies, I:

* Work as a **part-time cybersecurity intern**
* Serve as a **university tutor**
* Teach a **private psychology course** on an educational platform
* Build and maintain technical systems, documentation, and learning resources

My long-term goal is to work in **cybersecurity with a red team mindset**—thinking like an attacker to identify weaknesses, break systems safely, and help build stronger defenses. At the same time, I deliberately develop **software engineering skills** (web, systems, and backend concepts) to become a well-rounded engineer who understands both **how systems are built** and **how they are broken**.

## How to Use This Section

* **If you are an employer** → Start with **Projects** and **Resume**
* **If you are an instructor** → Explore **Workshops** and how I document and structure technical work
* **If you are a student** → You can see how I approach learning, projects, and technical documentation

This section is meant to show **how I work**, not just what I claim to know.

## What I Focus On

### Cybersecurity (Primary Interest)

* Penetration testing mindset and attacker methodology
* Vulnerability analysis and system weakness identification
* Ethical and structured security testing
* Long-term goal: red team, then broader blue/purple team exposure

### Software Engineering (Core Foundation)

* System design and documentation
* Databases and backend concepts
* Structured development and requirements-driven work
* Web systems, deployment, and hosting (including this site)

### Learning & Teaching

* University tutoring and workshop participation
* Clear, structured technical documentation
* Explaining complex topics in a practical, usable way
* Strong preference for **hands-on, applied learning** over purely theoretical study

## Projects

Most of my projects are **university-based and team-oriented**, but my role consistently goes beyond minimum requirements—especially in:

* Building and deploying project websites
* Structuring documentation and deliverables
* Turning prototypes into working, hosted systems
* Taking responsibility for technical integration and presentation

I am especially proud of:

* A **CS102 project** that I built almost entirely from scratch under difficult team conditions
* An **SE201 project** where I took the prototype further than required, converting it into a deployed system using modern tooling

Each project is documented with:

* The problem it addresses
* The system design and implementation approach
* My personal contribution
* What I learned from building it

--> [**Projects**](./projects.md)

## Workshops & Teaching

I was invited to speak about my **experience as a student tutor**, focusing on:

* Mentorship and communication
* Instructional structure
* Professional growth and responsibility

In addition, I participated in technical workshops (including a **Cybersecurity Crash Course**) and documented the work in detail. My instructors specifically noted the **quality and depth of my documentation** compared to peers.

These workshops demonstrate:

* My ability to **communicate technical material clearly**
* My commitment to **structured, high-quality documentation**
* My interest in **teaching, mentoring, and knowledge sharing**

--> See: [**Workshops**](./Workshops/index.md)

## Resume (CV)

For a concise overview of my:

* Education
* Technical skills
* Experience
* Certifications and workshops

--> See: [Resume (CV)](./CV.html)

## How I Work

I am:

* Detail-oriented and systems-focused
* Strong in documentation, structure, and organization
* Practical and hands-on in how I learn
* More effective in **building and testing** than in purely theoretical or exam-based environments

I care deeply about:

* Doing work properly, not just “good enough”
* Taking projects beyond minimum requirements
* Making technical work **clear, usable, and well-presented**
* Continuously improving both my **engineering** and **security** skill sets

---

## Why This Exists

This website is:

* A **living record** of my technical growth
* A **portfolio of real work**, not just claims
* A demonstration of how I **design, document, and explain systems**
* A place where **software engineering, cybersecurity, and teaching** meet

It reflects not only what I know, but **how I apply, structure, and communicate that knowledge**.

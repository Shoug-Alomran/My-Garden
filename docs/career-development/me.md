# Me

I am a **Software Engineering and Cybersecurity student** at *Prince Sultan University* with a primary focus on **penetration testing, system analysis, and secure software design**. My work centers on understanding how systems are built, how they fail, and how they can be strengthened through structured engineering and security practices.

I am especially interested in security from an attacker minded perspective, not to exploit systems, but to identify weaknesses early and translate findings into concrete fixes, better designs, and safer user experiences.

## What I Work On

- **Penetration Testing and Security Analysis**  
  I analyze systems to identify weaknesses, focusing on web and network level issues, basic exploitation techniques, and misconfigurations. All work is conducted in authorized or controlled environments.

- **Application and System Development**  
  I build small applications, tools, and web based systems, often to solve specific workflow or documentation problems. My focus is on structure, clarity, and secure coding practices rather than just functionality.

- **Documentation and Knowledge Structuring**  
  A large part of my work is organizing technical material, project documentation, and learning resources in a way that is clear, reproducible, and useful to others.

## Current Roles and Experience

- **Cybersecurity Trainee at MDD**  
  Hands on work with penetration testing tasks, network analysis, and basic security hardening activities.

- **Course Instructor at Qimah**  
  Developing learning material and teaching structured approaches to understanding complex topics.

- **Peer Tutor at Prince Sultan University WTC**  
  Mentoring students in technical subjects and academic communication.

## Ethics and Professional Approach

I follow an ethics first approach to security work:

- I operate only with explicit permission, such as authorized engagements, lab environments, or my own infrastructure.  
- I practice responsible disclosure by reporting vulnerabilities privately and supporting safe remediation.  
- I prioritize secure development and mitigation over exploitation, with the goal of improving system safety and user protection.

## Technical Focus Areas

- Penetration testing for web and networked systems  
- Secure application development including authentication, input validation, and API design  
- Tooling and automation to support security testing and analysis  
- Research driven, hands on learning using writeups, labs, and technical references

## Training and Certifications

- **AI in Robotics Bootcamp 2025**, Prince Sultan University  
- **First Aid Provider**, Saudi Red Crescent Authority  
- Ongoing practical labs using platforms such as TryHackMe and Hack The Box  
- Long term certification goal includes advanced offensive security training when ready

## Why This Work Matters to Me

Good security comes from understanding systems deeply, finding problems early, and fixing them properly. I enjoy both sides of this process, the analytical side of testing and investigation, and the engineering side of building clearer, safer, and more reliable systems.

> Note: I only practice security testing in legal and authorized contexts. If you are interested in collaborating on a security assessment or review for a project, I am happy to discuss scope, authorization, and a responsible disclosure process first.

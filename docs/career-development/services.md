## What You Can Hire Me For

### 2. Academic Documentation Websites

## Delivery Principles

Every project is built with:

- Fixed scope and transparent boundaries
- Clean structure that is easy to maintain
- Clear revision control and content organization
- Practical layouts that work on desktop and mobile

## Service Boundaries

Blueprint provides **static website services only**.  
The following are outside scope:

- Full-stack applications
- Database systems
- Authentication logic
- SaaS product development
- Custom backend integrations

Projects requiring dynamic systems fall outside service scope.

## Domain and Hosting Notes

Projects are deployed using static hosting, usually GitHub Pages.

You can choose one of the following:

- Free GitHub Pages domain  
  Example: `username.github.io/project-name`
- Custom domain (purchased separately)

If no custom domain is provided, the project will remain live under the GitHub Pages URL.

Domain purchase, renewals, and third-party hosting costs are the client's responsibility unless explicitly agreed in writing.

## Quick Contact Prompt

If you want a fast estimate, send:

- Website type (Portfolio, Academic Docs, or Workshop/Course)
- Number of pages
- Deadline
- Whether you need a custom domain

# Shoug Fawaz Alomran — Digital Garden & Interactive CV

Welcome to my **Digital Garden**, a living space where I document my journey in **cybersecurity, software development, and personal growth**.  
Built using [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), this project serves as both an **interactive CV** and a **knowledge hub** — showcasing my projects, skills, and continuous learning path.
